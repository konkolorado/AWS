AWS basics:

1) Make an AWS account:
https://aws.amazon.com/console/

2) Launch an instance on the EC2 computing service
- Navigate to the Services pane in the top right corner
- Select EC2 from the drop down menu
- Select "Launch Instance" from the Create Instance section
- Choose the image appropriate for your goals (Free Tier, Red HaT Dist, etc)
- Choose instance computation type
- Hit "Review and Launch" then "Launch"
- Create a new key pair if this is your first time. Otherwise, use a preexisting key pair.
- Download keypair, run chmod 600 on it, and move it into ~/.ssh/ 
- The default Security Group for this instance should allow SSH access into the instance
- Wait a few minutes for the instance to properly Launch

3) Communicate (send / receive data) with the S3 storage service
- [Python] Install boto (Homebrew)
- Create a credentials text file
    - Navigate to the AWS console
    - Select "My Security Credentials"
    - Continue to Security Credentials
    - Expand the Access Keys tab
    - Create New Access Key, this will download a credentials file to your local computer
    - Examine the file to make sure the first line is '[Credentials]'
    - Rename the file as .boto and move to ~
- Type export AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=~/path/to/.botocreds
- You can now communicate with S3 using boto (see s3.py for examples)

4) SSH-ing into your running instance
- On console, Navigate to EC2
- Select "Running Instances" on the top tab
- Choose an instance, select "Connect"
- Copy the last line beginning with ssh, replace key.pem with the path and name to your own key permissions file
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/key.pem user@instance_id.amazonaws.com
- Continue connection
- NOTE: If you cannot ssh (connection timeout) it may be because your instance does not have its security groups properly setup to accept incoming ssh
connections. You'll have to update its security group details.


4) Setting up and Installing software on a (Linux) instance after SSH-ing in
- Upgrade pip
    - pip install --upgrade pip --user
- Use whereis to see which versions of pip are available (pip2.7 as of writing)
    - whereis pip
- Install packages necessary for your work
    - pip2.7 install numpy --user 


5) Updating Security Groups details to allow for SSH
- Navigate to EC2 service on AWS console
- Go to Running Instances 
- Select a running service, scroll to the far right under the "Security Groups" column. Select that entry
- In the lower window, select the Inbound tab. Make sure you have a row reading Type: SSH; Protocol: TCP; Port Range: 22; Source: 0.0.0.0/0
- If not, edit the Inbound rules and add one with the above configuration 


6) SCP files to your running instance
- scp -i ~/.ssh/key.pem filename user@instance.amazonaws.com:

7) A few remarks
- Terminate an instance when done working otherwise you will be charged/its idle time will count towards computation time
- Terminating an instance will clear an files saved locally on that instance. Use s3 to backup files or transfer work back to your local comp
 
8) Copy data from S3 to a running EC2 instance:
- Install aws command line tools:
    - pip2.7 install awscli --user
- Enter command
    - aws s3 cp s3:/bucket/path/to/filename.csv destination/filename.csv
